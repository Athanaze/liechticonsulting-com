I am passionate about building machine learning applications, with a particular focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and natural language processing. My work combines cutting-edge AI technology with practical applications, creating tools and solutions that make a real difference in how we interact with and utilize AI.

I also enjoy writing about learning methods and tools, sharing insights and experiences from my journey in the AI and software development landscape. My approach combines theoretical understanding with hands-on implementation, always striving to make complex concepts accessible and practical.
